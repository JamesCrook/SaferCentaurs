## Section: Who This Community Is For {.content-section}

Our Discord is designed for educators, content creators, and developers who are building tools using AI. Think 3Blue1Brown, Wikipedia diagram contributors, educational content creators, and software developers exploring human-AI collaboration patterns.

We're particularly interested in connecting with people who:

* Create educational content and need better diagram tools
* Build tools that combine human creativity with AI capabilities
* Contribute visual content to Wikipedia or other knowledge platforms
* Develop software with AI assistance while maintaining human control
